# Contributing Guide

Thanks for that you are interested in contributing to Modern.js. Before starting your contribution, please take a moment to read the following guidelines.

## Setup the Dev Environment

### Fork Your Own Repo

[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local.

### Install Node.js

We recommend using the LTS version of Node.js 16. You can check your currently used Node.js version with the following command:

```bash
node -v
#v16.18.0
```

If you do not have Node.js installed in your current environment, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to install it.

Here is an example of how to install the Node.js 16 LTS version via nvm:

```bash
# Install the LTS version of Node.js 16
nvm install 16 --lts

# Make the newly installed Node.js 16 as the default version
nvm alias default 16

# Switch to the newly installed Node.js 16
nvm use 16
```

### Install pnpm

```sh
# enable pnpm with corepack, only available on node >= `v14.19.0`
corepack enable
```

### Install Dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

What this will do:

- Install all dependencies
- Create symlinks between required packages in the monorepo
- Run the `prepare` script to build all packages (this will take some time, but is necessary to make ensure all package dependencies are built and available)

> A full rebuild of all packages is generally not required after this. If a new feature you are developing requires an updated version of another package, it is usually sufficient to build the necessary dependencies.

### Set your email for git

Make sure you have your email set up in `<https://github.com/settings/emails>`. This will be needed later when you want to submit a pull request.

Check that your git client is already configured:

```sh
git config --list | grep email
```

For global settings:

```sh
git config --global user.email "SOME_EMAIL@example.com"
```

For this repo only:

```sh
git config user.email "SOME_EMAIL@example.com"
```

## Making Changes and Building

Once you have set up your local development environment with your [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), we can start development.

### Checkout A New Branch

It is recommended to develop on a new branch, as it will make things easier later when you submit a pull request:

```sh
git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME
```

### Build the Package

To build the package you want to change, first open the package directory, then build the package:

```sh
# Replace some-package with the name of the package you want to work on
cd ./packages/some-package
pnpm run build
```

Alternatively, you can build the package from the root directory of the repository using the `--filter` option:

```sh
pnpm run --filter @modern-js/some-package build
```

Build all packages:

```sh
pnpm run prepare
```

If you need to clean all `node_modules/*` in the project:

```sh
pnpm run reset
```

## Testing

### Add New Tests

If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, then add some tests.

You can add unit test cases in the `<PACKAGE_DIR>/tests` folder. The test syntax is based on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

### Run Unit Tests

Before submitting a pull request, it's important to make sure that your changes haven't introduced any regressions or bugs. You can run the unit tests for the project by executing the following command:

```sh
pnpm run test
```

Alternatively, you can run the unit tests of single package using the `--filter` option:

```sh
pnpm run --filter @modern-js/some-package test
```

### Run E2E Tests

In addition to the unit tests, the project also includes end-to-end (E2E) tests, which checks the functionality of the application as a whole. To run the E2E tests, you'll need to follow these steps:

```sh
pnpm run test:e2e
```

If you need to run a specified test, you can add keywords to filter:

```sh
npx jest copy-assets
```

## Linting

To help maintain consistency and readability of the codebase, we use a ESLint to lint the codes. You can run the linter by executing the following command:

```sh
pnpm run lint
```

## Documentation

Currently Modern.js provides documentation in English and Chinese. If you can use Chinese, please update both documents at the same time. Otherwise, just update the English documentation.

You can find all the documentation in the `packages/document` folder:

```bash
root
└─ packages
   └─ document
       ├─ builder-doc    # Documentation for Modern.js Builder
       ├─ doc-tools-doc  # Documentation for Modern.js Doc
       ├─ main-doc       # Documentation for Modern.js Framework
       └─ module-doc     # Documentation for Modern.js Module
```

This website is built with [Modern.js Doc](https://modernjs.dev/doc-tools), the document content can be written using markdown or mdx syntax. You can refer to the [Modern.js Doc Website](https://modernjs.dev/doc-tools) for detailed usage.

The source code of Modern.js Doc can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/modern.js/tree/main/packages/solutions/doc-tools).

## Submitting Changes

Be sure that you have [set up your email](#set-your-email-appropriately-for-git) accordingly. Also make sure that you are [working on a new branch](#checkout-a-new-branch).

### Add a Changeset

Add changeset. Select changed packages in this commits and add changeset info.

```sh
pnpm run change
```

### Committing your Changes

Commit your changes to your forked repo, and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

### Format of PR titles

The format of PR titles follow Conventional Commits.

A example

```
feat(ui): Add `Button` component
^    ^    ^
|    |    |__ Subject
|    |_______ Scope
|____________ Type
```

Your PR

- must have a `Type`
- Optionally have a `Scope`
  - `Scope` should be lower case
- must have a `Subject`

## Publishing

We use **Modern.js Monorepo Solution** to manage version and changelog.

Repository maintainers can publish a new version of all packages to npm.

1. Fetch newest code at branch `main`.
2. Install

```sh
pnpm run setup
```

3. Prepare

```sh
pnpm run prepare
```

4. Bump version

```sh
pnpm run bump
```

5. Commit version change. The format of commit message should be `chore: va.b.c` which is the main version of current release.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "chore: va.b.c"
```
